# Codurance Katas

Repository with my solutions to the Codurance Katas. 

If you want to give a shot to solve the same katas they can be found on [The Codurance Katalyst](https://katalyst.codurance.com/). 

Time to develop solutions:
 - Simple Mars Rover:
   - 1st Working iteration ~5 hours, not proud...;
 - FizzBuzz:
   - 1st Working iteration ~2.5 hours. Taking to much time to create the project(~1h), the other time was used to absorb all the instructions. The challenge had no difficulty.
 - Leap Year:
   - 1st Working iteration ~45 minutes. Trying to absorb all the TDD rules.
 - Roman Numerals
   - 1st Working iteration ~4 hours. Spent a lot of time in the beginning absorbing TPP and then trying to find an algorithm to remove 4, 9, 40, 90, 400, and 900 duplication. But now, reading the transformations again, adding an value to the map may be considered a lower level transformation than adding an algorithm. I have to read more exemples and info. I believe that without TPP I would not find a solution so simple so fast. I still find very difficult to not think ahead of the tests I am writing.
