# Codurance Katas

Repository with my solutions to the Codurance Katas. 

If you want to give a shot to solve the same katas they can be found on [The Codurance Katalyst](https://katalyst.codurance.com/). 

Time to develop solutions:
 - Simple Mars Rover:
   - 1st Working iteration ~5 hours, not proud...;
 - FizzBuzz:
   - 1st Working iteration ~2.5 hours. Taking to much time to create the project(~1h), the other time was used to absorb all the instructions. The challenge had no difficulty.
 - Leap Year:
   - 1st Working iteration ~45 minutes. Trying to absorb all the TDD rules.
